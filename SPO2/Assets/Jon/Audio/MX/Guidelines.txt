We are looking for several atmospheric tunes that suit the jungle environment. There needs to be a variety that enables us to dynamically change the music during a level which might change in mood. 

In general, during gameplay of the levels, a selection of ambience music plays in the background. It is not loud, as we want to allow for audio feedback from the sound effects.

The passages/transitions between the mood pieces are important in this regard.

When in an area of enemies the music should change dynamically into something more tense. For this we need to set up "audio zones" in unity. Such an audio zone should also encompass the entirety of the encroaching human civilization and the deforested area itself should have a sombre, melancholic feel to it.

Any in-game events, such as a forest fire, the death of a tiger, or expansion of human deforestion, will also trigger changes in the music, or play musical cues that informs the player about what happened.

Music is mainly divided into moods. There is a "DANGER" folder which contains more fast-paced and tense scores, and a folder named "EXPLORATION" for when all is quiet and there is no danger around. Additional folders might include such tags as "AMBIENCE", "TRANQUIL" and "EVENTS".
