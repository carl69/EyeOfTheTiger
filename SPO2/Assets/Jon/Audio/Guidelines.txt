Some scripting experience and work is neccessary for the sound design to work properly in the game. Where able to, the sound designers will set this up themselves, otherwise a programmer needs to be consulted. 

Likewise, several Unity features such as audio zones and controllers for audio need to be researched extensively, and the sound designers need to become comfortable using these tools as well as proTools from school. 

There is extensive sound library in school that needs to be taken advantage of and researched, as well as other sources such as the library at www.unippm.se

Sound effects and music go in their seperate folders with additional sub-folders in both.
