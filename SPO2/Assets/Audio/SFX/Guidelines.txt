Sound effects for the game goes in this folder.

Sound effects will be categorized according to their use in seperate folders.

Ex. Animal sound effects present in the levels go in their own folder called "ANIMALS"
Player character sound effects are not included in this folder, but goes into their own seperate folder called "PLAYER", inside of which there are subfolders for both the adult tiger and the cub.

Environmental sound effects goes into the folder "ENVIRONMENT". Such sound effects includes any background effects which have their own sub-folders such as "WATER", "ANIMALS", "CIVILIZATION".

In terms of general atmosphere, we want realistic sounds. Sounds that are easility identified and understood and lends itself well to the level design. Audio feedback is important, such as the rustling of leaves or trees that give away prey, or the humming and "bumbling" of an encroaching poacher. It should be clear to the player what is going on in the soundscape, and the effects can help with that.

This audio feedback needs to have a left-right alignment to let the player discern which direction it's coming from.
